# Assembling the SparkFun Weather Meter Kit

## Assemble the Sensor Hardware (15 min)

Follow the [SparkFun instructions for assembling the hardware](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/weather-meter-hookup-guide#hardware-assembly).

*Note1: These are great instructions, but it might be a little bit easier
to first attach the three sensors to their respective armatures.*

*Note2: The kit contains both “screws” (pointed ends) and “bolts” (flat ends).
The instructions to attach the rain sensors armature in the Armature
sections (between the 2nd and 3rd images) say “use one of the included
screws and nuts to lock it in place.”  This should read “bolts and nuts.”*

## Prepare the Carrier Board (5 min)

There is a detailed overview of the carrier board and the processor in
the SparkFun 
[MicroMod Weather Carrier Board Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-weather-carrier-board-hookup-guide).

In the guide you can scroll down to 
[Hardware Assembly]( https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micromod-esp32-processor-board-hookup-guide/hardware-hookup),
where there are illustrated instructions for mounting the processor on the
carrier board.

## Install Arduino IDE App on your computer (10 minutes)

Download the Arduino IDE App for your computer:
* [MacOS]()
* [Windows]()

## Move on to Software

At this point you are ready to move on to 
[set up your Arduino environment](https://github.com/cecat/WeatherStation/tree/main/src)
for
loading libraries and code.
