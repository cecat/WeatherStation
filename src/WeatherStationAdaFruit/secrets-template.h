// https://io.adafruit.com and click on the yellow key icon upper
// right, just left of the "New Device" icon.  It appears that for
// Adafruit rather than a client_ID you register devices to get a unique
// key for the device.

// If you create your own account you'll want to keep your credentials
// here, deleting the duplicate lines from topics.h.  But for this
// test code the values below are set in the topics.h file
// so the lines below are commented out.
