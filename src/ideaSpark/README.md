# ideaSpark Weather Kit

This repository is intended to augment the instruction manual for
the [ideaSpark Weather Station](https://gitlab.com/GJKJ/WSK).

After downloading the instruction manual from the ideaSpark repo
and unzipping it, we will go through the manual here.

(below is a work in progress to simplify the native instructions and make
them less Windows-specific)

## Step 1: Install USB-To-Serial

Download the [Mac OSX Driver from Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/Mac_OSX_VCP_Driver.zip).
(from the Silicon Labs USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers 
[download page](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads)).

Unzip the file and run the installer from the resulting folder. Wen you 
run the installer, you'll be asked if you trust the source (yes), then
a popup will tell you that this installer is trying to...well, install
a system component. The system will ask if you want to bail or open
system settings (to give permission). 
Since that is what we want, we select "open System
Settings" and hit the "Allow" button (it will say "System software
from application CP210xVCPDriver was blocked from loading"
